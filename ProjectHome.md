Chromium provides some very nice security properties by isolating untrusted code in sandboxed processes. The Capsicum project provides strong OS primitives to help applications sandbox themselves.

This project builds Chromium sandboxes on top of the firm foundation laid by Capsicum, resulting in strong OS-backed security guarantees.
